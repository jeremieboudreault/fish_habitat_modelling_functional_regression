The research entitled [***Modelling fish physico-thermal habitat selection using functional regression***](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/24705357.2020.1840313) was published in _Journal of Ecohydraulics_ in 2021.




Data
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------


Data are from __field survey__ that have been conducted during summer 2017 on the  __Sainte-Marguerite river__ (SMR) :

+ `data/field/*` : contains the raw .xlsx file filled after each day of field work 
+ `data/*` : contains the cleaned and transformed datasets 


R scripts
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------


Scripts are all from Jeremie Boudreault. They use the R package `mgcv` to fit __generalized additive models__ (GAM) and of `FDboost` to fit __functional regression models__ (FRM) :

+ `R/Data_initial_cleaning.R` : code to clean the field data spreadsheets and produce more adapted datasets
+ `R/Data_salmons_lengths.R`: code to convert the salmon lengths to number of fry and parr
+ `R/Data_per_site.R` : code to produce the observations at each site (mean value or functional observations)
+ `R/GAMs_all.R` : code to fit several types of GLM/GAM on the data using the `mgcv` package
+ `R/GAMs_best.R` : among all models, do variable selection to find the best GAM models and save them to `out/models`
+ `R/GAMs_predictions` : code to calculate the leave-one-out predictions for the GAMs
+ `R/FRMs_all.R` : code to fit several types of FRM on the data using the `FDboost` package
+ `R/FRMs_best.R` : among all models, select the best FRM models and save them to `out/models` 
+ `R/FRMs_predictions` : code to calculate the leave-one-out predictions for the FRMs
+ `R/Models_coefficients.R` : code to extract the coefficients of the best models
+ `R/Models_performance.R` : compare the results between GAMs and FRMs


Results
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------


A folder for the __results__ at each part of the coding process :

+ `out/data visualisation/*` : raw data visualisation and tables
+ `out/models/*` : fitted final models
+ `out/coefficients/*` : coefficients of the models
+ `out/predictions/*` : leave-one-out predictions and goodness-of-fit
